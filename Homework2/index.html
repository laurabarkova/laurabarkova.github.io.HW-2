            <p>By 2030, IT’s primary focus will shift to providing strategic business value by delivering innovative products and services. However, traditionally siloed and process-driven IT departments are not well suited for the speed and adaptability needed to take advantage of emerging digital business opportunities. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <p>This means that IT and business strategy must be aligned to boost the responsiveness and agility that will be required to compete in the future. This can be accomplished by embracing collaborative management techniques and increasing autonomy among IT staff.</p>

            <li>Ninety-eight percent of business data will be stored in the cloud rather than traditional company data centers. Few new technologies, or even business models, will be viable without relying on cloud technology.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing models such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) models will increasingly give way to a boundless Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) dynamic whereby IT is managed as a malleable product highly conducive to innovation.</li>
            <li>IT networks will be chiefly optimized for resilience and business continuity, better supporting rising priorities such as risk management, cybersecurity, and the near total adoption of remote work.</li>
            <li>Evolved 5G wireless networks will deliver high-bandwidth, low-latency connections that will power advanced industrial internet of things (IoT) and digital twin platforms. China will be in the process of building out the first 6G networks.</li>
            <li>Advanced edge computing will provide real-time local data processing, enhancing IoT systems while reducing network traffic in the cloud. Sensor-laden machines will increasingly communicate among themselves, make decisions without human intervention, and invoke self-healing mechanisms.</li>
